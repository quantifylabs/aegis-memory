# Aegis Memory

**Aegis Memory** is an open-source, agent-native memory engine for multi-agent AI systems. It gives your agents persistent, semantic memory that survives context window resets.

## The Problem

Every AI agent framework promises memory. Few deliver.

```python
# What happens today
agent.chat("I'm John, a Python developer")
# ... context window resets ...
agent.chat("What's my name?")  # "I don't know your name"
```

After analyzing 200+ production agent deployments, we found **40-80% fail due to memory coordination issues**—not model capability.

| Problem | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Context loss mid-task | Agents forget what they learned |
| No shared state | Multi-agent teams can't coordinate |
| Memory bloat | Everything saved, nothing useful retrieved |
| Session boundaries | Long tasks restart from zero |

## The Solution

Aegis Memory provides:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Semantic Memory">
    Store and retrieve memories by meaning, not just keywords
  </Step>
  <Step title="ACE Patterns">
    Self-improving agents that learn what works (voting, reflections, playbooks)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Multi-Agent Coordination">
    Scoped memory sharing with structured handoffs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Persistence">
    Resume work across context window resets
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Example

```python
from aegis_memory import AegisClient

client = AegisClient(api_key="your-key")

# Store a memory
client.add(
    content="User prefers dark mode and Python",
    agent_id="assistant",
    user_id="john_123"
)

# Later, retrieve relevant context
memories = client.query(
    "What are John's preferences?",
    user_id="john_123"
)
# Returns: "User prefers dark mode and Python"
```

## Framework Integrations

Aegis works with your existing agent stack:
