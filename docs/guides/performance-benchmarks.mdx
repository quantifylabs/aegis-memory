# Performance Benchmarks (Placeholder)

This page is a temporary benchmark source-of-truth referenced by the README while full benchmark artifacts are being finalized.

## Current methodology snapshot

- **Dataset size:** 1,000,000 memories in a single namespace
- **Hardware profile:** 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, local NVMe SSD, Linux host
- **Query parameters:** semantic query with `top_k=10`, default reranker disabled, warm index cache

## Benchmark source

Until dedicated benchmark scripts are published, use this document as the canonical methodology reference for the README Performance table.

> TODO: replace this placeholder with committed benchmark scripts/config and attach reproducible result artifacts (raw runs + summarized percentiles).
